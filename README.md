•	**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

For this project, we were given starter code for an intelligent agent (a pirate) to learn to solve a pathfinding problem. The goal was for the agent to find the optimal path through the course to reach the end (treasure). A neural network and python files with classes/functions were given to us for the problem. We were asked to create and implement the reinforcement learning concept of Deep Q-Learning/Training algorithm portion of the project.

o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists work to solve complex technological and computer problems and create/apply solutions through research and development. Their work matters because it helps advance technology while ensuring safety and security throughout all the advancements. 

o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

In my opinion, approaching a problem like any other scientist would is a good basis. Start with a critical analysis, then a hypothesis or ideas about the problem, and test. For example, with debugging or finding errors within a code, I could analyze the data and based on knowledge and research, create ideas or hypotheses on why the bug or error might have occurred, and then test. Sometimes errors can be found with just the first step of analysis with simple typos or syntax errors. 
With this course, I encountered multiple bugs with simple fixes just by analyzing my code and set up. 

o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My responsibilities are to ensure the online/technological safety and security for the end user and for the organization with the program and data I handle, while also meeting expectations and user/organization needs.
